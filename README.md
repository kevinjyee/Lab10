# Wreck-It-Ralph-Game

Redesigned the classic Wreck it Ralph Video Game in C:

This project includes a two player interface played on the TI MSP430 Microcontroller

Player 1 plays as Ralph: Ralph drops bricks on windows.
Player 2 plays as Felix: Felix dodges the bricks while attempting to fix the windows.

The program utilizes ADC controls and hit detection.
